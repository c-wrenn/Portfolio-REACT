                Hello, my name is Crislyn Wren. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been attending Collin College,
                 and recently gained my associates degree.
                I plan to continue my education in Computer Science at Texas Tech University.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have completed the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at SMU
                and graduated as of November of 2023. I have been able to create
                many projects from the Boot Camp using various coding languages,
                mainly MERN stack. My goal is to acquire a stable career in this
                field of work.
